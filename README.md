<ins> Abstract </ins> </br>
The research question posed is:"To what extent does information gathered from party platforms correlate to the results of a general election in the US?"
More specifically, I investigated the hypothesis: "The higher the textual similarity between the party platforms, the closer the margins would be in the general election".
The approach is to treat party platforms as document-term matrices and apply word and phrases based cosine similarity to them throughout the years with different general election platforms. 
The conclusion drawn is that there is a weak positive correlation between the similarity between party platforms and the margin of voting outcomes.
